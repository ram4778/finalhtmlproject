    <h1>E-commerce Website</h1>
    <p>
      This is an e-commerce website project that showcases a variety of products
      for sale. It features a user-friendly interface, product categories, a
      shopping cart, and secure checkout options. Built using HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript, this project demonstrates my skills in frontend development
      and my ability to create functional web applications.
